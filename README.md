## Overview

I believe tha game meets all the requirements. I was hoping to add animations and finish a clock feature before I turned it in though.

##Items
The player must collect 5 item in order to win. These items are all created with the gem class.

##Hearts
The player will lose Hearts based on collision with enemies. If the player loses their last heart then the player will lose the game and is notified of the loss. 

##Future Move Implmentation
I am planning to add animations for when the player loses Hearts/Collides with the bug.

## JavaScript
I made three different classes, Heart, Player, and Gem. I expanded on the enemy function of course as well. I added different functions and variables to help me update the logic.

I put the lock JavaScript into its own file. 

##HTML
I used the base HTML and really didn't do too much to change it. I added some menu and header stuff.

##CSS
THe biggest CSS changes I made was coloring the icons to match the gems being collected

##sweetalert
I added the dependency Sweet Alert which can be found at the bottom of the index.html page: <script defer src="https://unpkg.com/sweetalert/dist/sweetalert.min.js"></script>

## Futrue time implementation
I was planning to use the clock to keep track of the seconds and shake and turn red when the player got below 40 seconds of time remaining. Just like I did in my last game.
